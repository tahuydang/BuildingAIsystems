### AI Dev Environment includes
1. Python: 
   Massive AI ecosystem: TensorFlow, Pytorch, OpenAI, Langchain
   Works across platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux - Write once run anywhere
   Easy API integration: Connect to GPT, Claude, Gemini with just a few lines
2. Dependency isolation
3. Project structure
    A clean AI project has 
        Source code folder
        Dependency file
        Configuration files
        Documentation
    -> Good structure scales from prototype to production

4. Version control

### From code to AI Response
1. Call an LLM API from python

2. Pass input text to the model

3. Receive and print output

4. Control behavior with parameters

Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables.
